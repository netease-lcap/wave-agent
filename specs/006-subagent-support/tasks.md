# Tasks: Subagent Support

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-subagent-support/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT included as they were not requested in the feature specification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 [P] Update packages/agent-sdk/src/types.ts to export subagent message block types

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T002 Create TaskDelegation interface in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/types.ts
- [ ] T003 [P] Create SubagentConfiguration interface in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T004 [P] Create SubagentInstance interface in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T005 [P] Create SubagentBlock interface in packages/agent-sdk/src/types.ts
- [ ] T006 [P] Extend MessageManagerCallbacks interface in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/messageManager.ts
- [ ] T007 Create base SubagentManager class in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T008 Create subagent configuration parser utilities in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Load and Parse User-Created Subagents (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Wave Agent SDK automatically discovers and loads manually-created subagent configuration files

**Independent Test**: Manually create a subagent configuration file in .wave/agents/ with valid YAML frontmatter and verify it can be discovered, loaded and parsed by the SDK

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Implement YAML frontmatter parsing logic in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Implement directory scanning for .wave/agents/ and ~/.wave/agents/ in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T011 [US1] Implement subagent configuration validation (name pattern, required fields) in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement precedence rules (project over user) in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T013 [US1] Add configuration loading methods to SubagentManager in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T014 [US1] Add error handling for invalid YAML and missing fields in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Automatic Task Delegation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Wave Agent automatically recognizes when a task matches a subagent's expertise and delegates appropriately

**Independent Test**: Configure subagents with clear expertise descriptions and issue tasks that match those descriptions, then verify automatic delegation occurs

**Note**: This implementation also handles explicit subagent invocation (User Story 3) automatically through the Task tool's subagent selection logic

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T015 [P] [US2] Create Task tool plugin structure in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts
- [ ] T016 [P] [US2] Implement task description matching algorithm in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T017 [US2] Implement subagent selection logic with specificity scoring and explicit name matching in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T018 [US2] Create SubagentInstance creation logic in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T019 [US2] Implement isolated aiManager and messageManager per instance in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T020 [US2] Implement Task tool execute method with delegation workflow in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts
- [ ] T021 [US2] Add Task tool to tool registry in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/index.ts
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement tool access restriction based on subagent configuration in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T023 [US2] Implement model configuration per subagent in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts
- [ ] T024 [US2] Implement clear feedback about which subagent is handling a task in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts
- [ ] T025 [US2] Add error handling for nonexistent subagents with available subagents listing in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1, 2, and 3 (explicit invocation) should all work through the Task tool mechanism

---

## Phase 5: User Story 5 - Subagent Message Display (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Subagent conversations display as expandable blocks within the message list for tracking activity while maintaining main conversation focus

**Independent Test**: Trigger a subagent and verify the message block appears with correct visual indicators, collapse/expand behavior, and message preview functionality

### Implementation for User Story 5

- [ ] T026 [P] [US5] Create SubagentBlock React component in packages/code/src/components/SubagentBlock.tsx
- [ ] T027 [P] [US5] Implement collapsed state showing up to 2 recent messages in packages/code/src/components/SubagentBlock.tsx
- [ ] T028 [P] [US5] Implement expanded state showing up to 10 recent messages in packages/code/src/components/SubagentBlock.tsx
- [ ] T029 [P] [US5] Add distinctive border styling with magenta color in packages/code/src/components/SubagentBlock.tsx
- [ ] T030 [P] [US5] Implement subagent name/icon header with status indicators in packages/code/src/components/SubagentBlock.tsx
- [ ] T031 [US5] Add SubagentBlock rendering to MessageList in packages/code/src/components/MessageList.tsx
- [ ] T032 [US5] Integrate SubagentBlock with existing isExpanded prop pattern in packages/code/src/components/MessageList.tsx
- [ ] T033 [US5] Add SubagentBlock message creation in Task tool result processing in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Edge Cases & Error Handling

**Purpose**: Handle edge cases and error conditions identified in specification

- [ ] T034 [P] [EH] Implement invalid YAML frontmatter error handling in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T035 [P] [EH] Implement tool validation for subagent configurations in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts  
- [ ] T036 [P] [EH] Implement fallback to main agent when no subagent matches in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts
- [ ] T037 [P] [EH] Add handling for missing required fields in subagent configs in packages/agent-sdk/src/utils/subagentParser.ts
- [ ] T038 [EH] Add handling for unavailable or invalid model specifications in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] T039 [P] Update packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/messageManager.ts to handle SubagentBlock message creation
- [ ] T040 [P] Add comprehensive error handling across all subagent operations
- [ ] T041 [P] Implement performance optimization for subagent selection (<500ms target)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2)
- **Edge Cases (Phase 6)**: Can start after relevant user stories complete
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 configuration loading
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: ‚úÖ **HANDLED AUTOMATICALLY** by User Story 2 Task tool implementation
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: ‚úÖ **HANDLED BY T019** - Isolated aiManager and messageManager per instance provides context isolation
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after US2 completion - Adds UI layer for subagent display

### Within Each User Story

- Configuration utilities before managers
- Interfaces before implementations
- Core logic before UI components
- Tool registration after tool implementation
- Error handling after core functionality
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once US1 completes, US2/US5 can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Within each user story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- UI components (US5) can be developed in parallel with backend logic
- Edge case handling (Phase 7) can be developed in parallel with user stories

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2

```bash
# Launch foundational interfaces together:
Task: "Create Task tool plugin structure in packages/agent-sdk/src/tools/taskTool.ts"
Task: "Implement task description matching algorithm in packages/agent-sdk/src/managers/subagentManager.ts"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently - create and load subagent configs
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (automatic + explicit delegation + context isolation)
4. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (full feature)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (configuration)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (delegation + context isolation) - starts after US1
   - Developer C: User Story 5 (UI) - starts after US2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- [EH] label indicates edge case handling tasks
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests included as they were not requested in specification
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Build packages/agent-sdk before packages/code due to dependency
- Follow existing tool plugin patterns and React component patterns
- YAML parsing reuses existing infrastructure from skills and custom slash commands
- User Story 3 (explicit invocation) handled automatically by Task tool mechanism - no separate implementation needed
- User Story 4 (context isolation) handled by T019 isolated aiManager/messageManager - no additional tasks needed
