# Bash History Selector Plan

## Phase 1: UI/UX Improvements
- Add syntax highlighting to the commands in the history list.
- Improve the timestamp formatting (e.g., "2 hours ago").

## Phase 2: Advanced Search
- Implement fuzzy searching for history commands.
- Add the ability to filter by date range.

## Phase 3: Persistence and Sync
- Ensure history is persisted across sessions (currently handled by `wave-agent-sdk`).
- Add an option to export/import bash history.
