# Research Findings: Custom Slash Commands

**Generated**: December 19, 2024  
**Feature**: Custom Slash Commands Implementation Analysis

## Research Overview

Since this feature is already implemented, this research documents the existing architectural decisions, design patterns, and technical approaches used in the current codebase.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### Decision: SlashCommandManager as Central Orchestrator
**Rationale**: Centralized command lifecycle management (registration, discovery, execution, cleanup) provides clear responsibility separation and enables consistent behavior across all command types (built-in and custom).

**Alternatives considered**:
- Distributed command handling across multiple managers
- Direct integration without abstraction layer
- Event-driven command system

**Why chosen**: Single point of control simplifies testing, debugging, and feature extensions while maintaining clean separation from AI and message management concerns.

### Decision: File-System Based Command Discovery
**Rationale**: Automatic scanning of `.wave/commands/` directories provides zero-configuration user experience while supporting both project-specific and user-global command scopes.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Configuration file-based registration
- Database storage for commands
- Runtime-only command registration

**Why chosen**: Aligns with developer workflow expectations (file-based configuration), requires no additional infrastructure, and provides natural version control integration.

### Decision: Markdown + YAML Frontmatter Format
**Rationale**: Familiar format for developers, supports both human-readable content and structured configuration, enables rich documentation within command definitions.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure YAML configuration files
- JSON-based command definitions
- Custom DSL for command specification

**Why chosen**: Markdown provides natural documentation capabilities while YAML frontmatter handles structured configuration needs. Leverages existing `gray-matter` parsing ecosystem.

## Parameter Substitution Strategy

### Decision: Shell-Style Parameter Syntax
**Rationale**: Uses familiar `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2` syntax that developers recognize from shell scripting, providing intuitive mental model for command templating.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Mustache/Handlebars template syntax
- Custom placeholder format
- Function-call style parameters

**Why chosen**: Shell syntax is universal among developers, requires no additional learning, and handles both positional and aggregate parameter scenarios naturally.

### Decision: Quoted Argument Parsing
**Rationale**: Proper handling of quoted strings enables complex parameter values (including spaces, special characters) while maintaining shell-like behavior expectations.

**Implementation**: Custom parsing logic handles escape sequences, nested quotes, and whitespace preservation within quoted boundaries.

## User Interface Patterns

### Decision: Inline Command Selector
**Rationale**: Triggered by `/` character, provides immediate feedback with search-as-you-type functionality, maintains chat flow context.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate command palette window
- Tab-completion based approach
- Context menu integration

**Why chosen**: Inline approach maintains conversational flow while providing discovery capabilities. Search filtering enables quick navigation through large command sets.

### Decision: React + Ink Architecture
**Rationale**: Leverages existing CLI framework for consistent terminal UI experience, provides familiar React development patterns for UI components.

**Implementation**: CommandSelector component handles keyboard navigation, search filtering, and selection logic with proper focus management.

## Integration Patterns

### Decision: Agent-Centric Command Execution
**Rationale**: Commands execute within main agent context rather than spawning sub-agents, preserving conversation continuity and enabling access to full tool set.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Isolated command execution environments
- Sub-agent delegation for each command
- Direct tool invocation without AI involvement

**Why chosen**: Maintains conversation context, enables natural AI reasoning about command results, simplifies error handling and user experience.

### Decision: Bash Command Embedding
**Rationale**: Supports dynamic command content generation by executing bash commands within markdown and substituting results, enabling data-driven command templates.

**Implementation**: Pre-execution parsing identifies bash commands, executes them in working directory context, replaces placeholders with output.

## Performance Optimizations

### Decision: Lazy Command Loading
**Rationale**: Commands loaded on startup and reloaded on file changes rather than parsing files on each execution, balancing responsiveness with resource usage.

**Implementation**: File system watching (implicit through reload API) enables dynamic updates without application restart.

### Decision: In-Memory Command Registry
**Rationale**: Map-based command storage provides O(1) lookup performance for command execution and validation operations.

**Trade-offs**: Memory usage scales with command count, but enables instant command validation and execution.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Decision: Graceful Degradation
**Rationale**: Invalid commands are skipped with warnings rather than blocking entire command loading process, ensuring system remains functional with partial command sets.

**Implementation**: Try/catch blocks around individual command parsing with continued processing of remaining commands.

### Decision: User-Friendly Error Messages
**Rationale**: Command execution errors are captured and displayed in chat context rather than crashing the application, maintaining conversational flow.

**Implementation**: Error blocks in message system provide structured error presentation without interrupting chat session.

## Security Considerations

### Decision: Tool Restriction Support
**Rationale**: Commands can specify `allowedTools` in frontmatter to limit AI capabilities during execution, providing security boundary for potentially dangerous operations.

**Implementation**: Configuration passed to AI manager during command execution to enforce tool access restrictions.

### Decision: Bash Execution in Working Directory
**Rationale**: Bash commands execute in project working directory context, providing expected file system access while maintaining process isolation.

**Constraints**: 30-second timeout on bash execution prevents infinite loops or hanging operations.

## Conclusion

The implemented architecture demonstrates mature understanding of developer workflow patterns, provides robust error handling, and maintains clean separation of concerns across packages. The design choices prioritize user experience (zero configuration, familiar syntax) while providing extensibility hooks for future enhancements.
