# Research: Hooks System Implementation

**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Feature**: Hooks Support  
**Purpose**: Resolve technical implementation decisions and patterns

## Hook Event Integration Points

### Decision: Agent Lifecycle Integration
**Rationale**: Integrate hooks directly into the existing Agent class workflow at specific lifecycle points rather than creating a separate event system.

**Integration Points Identified**:
- PreToolUse: Before tool parameter processing in agent.ts
- PostToolUse: After successful tool execution completion  
- UserPromptSubmit: At prompt intake before AI processing begins
- Stop: When AI response cycle completes (no more tool calls)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- EventEmitter-based system: Rejected due to added complexity and potential memory leaks
- Middleware pattern: Rejected as hooks are not request/response interceptors but lifecycle callbacks

## Hook Execution Strategy  

### Decision: Isolated Process Execution
**Rationale**: Execute hook commands as isolated child processes to prevent hook failures from affecting main Wave operations, enable cross-platform compatibility, and provide security isolation.

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use Node.js `child_process.spawn()` for command execution
- Set timeout limits to prevent hanging hooks
- Capture stdout/stderr for logging without blocking main thread
- Provide WAVE_PROJECT_DIR environment variable injection

**Alternatives Considered**:
- In-process execution: Rejected due to potential for hooks to crash main application
- Worker threads: Rejected as unnecessary complexity for shell command execution

## Pattern Matching Strategy

### Decision: Minimatch Library Integration  
**Rationale**: Use existing minimatch dependency (already in agent-sdk) for glob-style pattern matching, with regex support for advanced patterns.

**Pattern Support**:
- Exact string matching: `"Write"` matches only Write tool
- Glob patterns: `"*"` matches all tools
- Regex patterns: `"Edit|Write"` for multiple tools
- Case-sensitive matching to maintain precision

## Configuration Management

### Decision: JSON Settings File Extension
**Rationale**: Extend existing settings.json structure in both user (~/.wave/) and project (.wave/) locations to maintain consistency with current Wave configuration approach.

**Configuration Structure**:
```typescript
interface HookConfiguration {
  hooks: {
    [eventName: string]: Array<{
      matcher?: string; // Optional for events without tools
      hooks: Array<{
        type: "command";
        command: string;
      }>;
    }>;
  };
}
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate hook configuration files: Rejected to avoid configuration fragmentation
- YAML format: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing JSON settings

## Error Handling & Logging

### Decision: Non-blocking Failure Mode
**Rationale**: Hook execution failures should be logged but never interrupt main Wave operations, maintaining system reliability while providing visibility into hook issues.

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- Log hook execution start/completion/failure events
- Capture and log hook command output for debugging
- Continue main workflow regardless of hook success/failure
- Provide clear error messages for common configuration mistakes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Blocking failure mode: Rejected as it could make Wave unreliable due to hook issues
- Silent failure mode: Rejected as it provides no debugging feedback to users

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Asynchronous Hook Execution with Timeout
**Rationale**: Execute hooks asynchronously to minimize impact on main workflow, with configurable timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging.

**Performance Strategy**:
- Default 10-second timeout per hook command
- Parallel execution of multiple hooks for same event
- Minimal memory footprint by avoiding hook result storage
- Early termination of hooks on timeout

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Synchronous execution: Rejected due to potential for significant workflow delays
- No timeout limits: Rejected as hanging hooks could accumulate and consume resources
