# Feature Specification: Hooks Support

**Feature Branch**: `001-hooks-support`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Support hooks, refer to hooks.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Configure Hook for Code Quality Checks (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to configure hooks that automatically run code quality checks after file editing operations, so that I can maintain consistent code standards without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the most common use case for hooks - automated quality assurance. It provides immediate value by catching issues early in the development process.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a PostToolUse hook for Edit operations, editing a file, and verifying the quality check command executes and provides feedback.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project with hooks configured for PostToolUse Edit operations, **When** I edit a file using the Edit tool, **Then** the configured code quality script executes automatically
2. **Given** multiple hooks configured for the same event, **When** the triggering event occurs, **Then** all matching hooks execute in the defined order
3. **Given** a hook command that fails, **When** the hook executes, **Then** the failure is logged but does not interrupt the main tool operation

### User Story 2 - Validate User Prompts Before Processing (Priority: P2)

As a project maintainer, I want to validate user prompts before Wave processes them, so that I can enforce project-specific guidelines or add contextual information automatically.

**Why this priority**: Enables proactive control over AI interactions and can improve response quality by adding context, but less immediately critical than post-action validation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a UserPromptSubmit hook, submitting various prompts, and verifying validation/context-addition logic executes correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a UserPromptSubmit hook is configured, **When** a user submits a prompt, **Then** the validation script executes before Wave processes the prompt
2. **Given** a prompt validation script that modifies context, **When** the validation runs, **Then** the additional context is available to Wave's processing

### User Story 3 - Execute Tasks After AI Response Completion (Priority: P3)

As a developer, I want to run finalization tasks when Wave finishes generating its response (no more tool calls), so that I can perform post-processing or state updates after each AI interaction cycle.

**Why this priority**: Useful for post-response workflows like logging, state updates, or triggering follow-up processes, but not critical for basic hook functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a Stop hook, having Wave complete a response cycle with no further tool calls, and verifying the configured tasks execute properly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a Stop hook is configured, **When** Wave finishes its response cycle with no more tool calls, **Then** the configured commands execute
2. **Given** a Stop hook with project-specific scripts, **When** the AI response is complete, **Then** the post-processing tasks run automatically

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a hook command fails or times out?
- How does the system handle hooks that modify files while Wave is still processing?
- What occurs when multiple hooks are configured for the same event with conflicting operations?
- How are environment variables handled in different execution contexts?
- What happens when hook scripts are not executable or missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support configuring hooks in both user-level (~/.wave/settings.json) and project-level (.wave/settings.json) settings files
- **FR-002**: System MUST support PreToolUse hooks that execute before tool processing begins
- **FR-003**: System MUST support PostToolUse hooks that execute after successful tool completion
- **FR-004**: System MUST support UserPromptSubmit hooks that execute when users submit prompts
- **FR-005**: System MUST support Stop hooks that execute when Wave finishes its response cycle (no more tool calls to generate)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support tool name pattern matching including exact strings, regex patterns, and wildcard (*) matching
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide WAVE_PROJECT_DIR environment variable to hook commands for project-relative script execution
- **FR-008**: System MUST execute multiple hooks for the same event in the configured order
- **FR-009**: System MUST log hook execution results and errors without interrupting main tool operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST support command-type hooks with configurable bash commands

### Key Entities

- **Hook Configuration**: Settings structure containing event mappings, matchers, and command definitions
- **Hook Event**: Specific trigger points in Wave's execution cycle (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop)
- **Hook Matcher**: Pattern matching system for determining which hooks apply to specific tool operations
- **Hook Command**: Executable bash commands with access to Wave environment variables

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can configure and execute hooks within 5 minutes of reading documentation
- **SC-002**: Hook commands execute within 10 seconds of their triggering events
- **SC-003**: Hook execution failures do not interrupt or delay main Wave operations by more than 1 second
- **SC-004**: 95% of common development workflow hooks (linting, formatting, testing) can be configured without custom scripting
- **SC-005**: Hook configuration validation catches 90% of common configuration errors before execution
