# File Selector Quickstart

## How to use the File Selector

1.  **Trigger**: In the terminal input, type `@`.
2.  **Search**: Continue typing to filter the file list. For example, `@src/` will show files in the `src` directory.
3.  **Navigate**: Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to highlight the desired file or directory.
4.  **Select**: Press `Enter` or `Tab` to insert the highlighted path into your input.
5.  **Cancel**: Press `Escape` or backspace over the `@` to close the selector.

## Example
