# Feature Specification: Test Coverage

**Feature Branch**: `061-test-coverage`  
**Created**: 2026-02-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "support test coverage"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Coverage Reporting (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want the system to automatically calculate test coverage whenever tests are run, so that I can monitor the health and thoroughness of the test suite without manual effort.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality. Without automated calculation, there is no data to display.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the test suite and verifying that a coverage report (e.g., LCOV, JSON, or HTML) is generated in a standard location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a codebase with existing tests, **When** the test command is executed with coverage enabled, **Then** a coverage report is generated.
2. **Given** a codebase with no tests, **When** the test command is executed with coverage enabled, **Then** the system reports 0% coverage or an appropriate empty state.

### User Story 2 - Local Coverage Inspection (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I want to be able to inspect coverage reports locally, so that I can identify specific lines of code that are not covered by tests.

**Why this priority**: Enables developers to improve coverage effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running tests locally and opening the generated HTML report.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a local development environment, **When** running tests with coverage, **Then** an HTML report is generated that can be opened in a browser.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when coverage drops below a certain threshold?** The system should ideally provide a warning or fail the build if a minimum threshold is not met (though this might be a separate requirement).
- **How does the system handle monorepos?** It should be able to aggregate coverage across multiple packages or show them individually.
- **What if the coverage service is down?** The README badge should show a "unknown" or "error" state rather than breaking the README layout.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a test coverage report in a standard format (e.g., LCOV) during the CI process.
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract the total coverage percentage from the generated report.
- **FR-003**: System MUST fail the build if total coverage falls below a specific threshold (e.g., 80%).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Coverage Report**: The raw data generated by the test runner containing line/branch coverage details.
- **CI Pipeline**: The automated workflow that runs tests and validates coverage.

## Assumptions

- The project uses a standard test runner (like Vitest, as mentioned in AGENTS.md) that supports coverage reporting.
- The project is hosted on GitHub and uses GitHub Actions for CI.
