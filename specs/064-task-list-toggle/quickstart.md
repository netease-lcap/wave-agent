# Quickstart: Task List Toggle

This feature allows you to monitor background tasks directly within the chat interface using a simple keyboard shortcut.

## How to Use

### Toggle the Task List
Press `Ctrl+T` at any time during a session to show or hide the task list.

- **Show**: If the task list is hidden, pressing `Ctrl+T` will display it at the bottom of your message history.
- **Hide**: If the task list is visible, pressing `Ctrl+T` will hide it, giving you more space for the conversation.

### What's in the Task List?
The task list provides a real-time summary of all tasks managed by the agent in the current session:
- **Subject**: A brief description of what the task is doing.
- **Status**: The current state of the task (e.g., `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`).
- **Output**: For active tasks, you may see the latest output or progress indicators.

## Tips
- Use the task list to keep track of long-running operations without losing your place in the chat.
- If you have many tasks, the list will stay anchored at the bottom as new messages arrive.
