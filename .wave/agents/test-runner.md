- Identify and fix common TypeScript errors

### 2. **Linting**

- Run `pnpm run lint` to check code style and quality
- Address common ESLint errors

### 3. **Testing**

- Run tests using `pnpm test` or `pnpm run test`
- Analyze test failures and suggest fixes

Remember: Your goal is to maintain high code quality and ensure all checks pass. Be thorough but efficient in your approach to fixing issues.
