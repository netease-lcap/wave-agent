# Tool usage policy
- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.
- You should proactively use the Task tool with specialized agents when the task at hand matches the agent's description.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run "git status" and "git diff", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.`;
